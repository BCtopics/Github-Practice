### Description

This project is built to help walk students through their first Git and Github experience.

* Add, commit, and push those changes to Github using Git
* Create a new branch
* Create a pull request
* Fork a project

## Guide

### Forking this Project

Forking is a way to copy a existing repository to your own profile. This way, you have full modifying capibilities. In this example this will allow you to modify the project and push your own version up to Github.

1. Navigate to the Repository on Github (You're already there).
2. Locate the fork button
3. Click this button, wait a moment for it to finish. You should then be relocated to your own version of the project. You can tell because it will have ```your username/Github-Practice``` instead of saying ```BCTopics/Github-Practice```.

### Cloning this Project

Cloning a project is similar to downloading a project. By cloning this project from Github using Git you will have access to this project on your local machine.

1. Navigate to YOUR Repository on Github (You're already there).
2. Click on the green code button. Copy this URL to your clipboard using Command and C or hit the handy button to the right of the URL that does it for you.
3. Open up terminal
4. Navigate to you're intended directory. To navigate to the desktop type cd Desktop/
5. Type: ```git clone [URL GOES HERE]```
6. Now that you have cloned the project down to your machine we need to navigate to inside that project. To do this type: ```cd Github-Practice/```
7. To confirm you have done these steps correctly when typing: ```git status``` it should tell you that you are on a specific branch.

### Create a new branch

It's best practice to work off a develop branch, not master. 

1. Let's create a new branch called develop. To do this type ```git checkout -b develop```
2. You should now be on your new develop branch. To confirm this type ```git status``` it should mention what branch you are on.

### Connect your new branch to Github

To have this branch exist on Github we will need to do one additional step. We need to connect our local branch ```develop``` to our remote branch on Github called ```develop```(Which doesn't exist yet).

1. In terminal, type: ```git push -u origin develop```

### Modifying the name File

Let's add our name to a README file.

1. Open up normally the file README.md using a IDE or basic text editor. I would personally use sublime.
2. Go to the very bottom of the file where the section says "names"
3. Add your name to this list, after your name and a space put the following ```:heavy_check_mark:```. This will appear as a checkmark.
4. Save your changes but either manually clicking save or hitting Command and S

### Getting our changes on GitHub

Now that we have our changes saved we need to go through our Git and Github workflow.

1. Go back to terminal. If you closed it previously make sure you navigate back inside the directory with the repository.
2. To add our changes to Git we need to type ```git add .```. Hit return.
3. We need to then commit our changes letting everyone know what we changed. To do this type ```git commit -m "Add [insert your name here] to the README.md file"```.
4. Next we need to push these changes up to Github. To do this type ```git push```.

### Add me as a contributor

To accept a pull request I will need to be added as a contributor. This allows me to make changes to your repository.

1. Click on the settings tab inside of your Github-Practice repository.
2. Under access it should say Collaborators on the left side. Click on that.
3. Hit the green Add people button. Type my username which is BCTopics.
4. Hit the select contributor button. 

### Create a pull request

Last you want to create a pull request to merge the develop branch into the main branch. This add your name to the list.

1. Go to the Pull requests tab inside of your version of the Github-Practice repository.
2. New pull-request
3. Add the rest of these later...
